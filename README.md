## Installation

### Requirements

### Standard Installation

To install Ronu as your default theme, first clone this repository in the `themes/` directory:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/softwareyoga/ronu-hugo-theme
```

OR

From the root of your site, execute:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/softwareyoga/ronu-hugo-theme.git themes/ronu-hugo-theme
```

Second, specify `ronu-hugo-theme` as your default theme in the `config.toml` file. Just add the line

```
    theme = "ronu-hugo-theme"
```

at the top of the file.

## Basic configuration

First include the following configuration in the config file: 

```toml
# Site settings
baseURL = "https://www.example.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "MySiteTitle"
theme = "ronu-hugo-theme"

# By default Hugo assumes the section with most pages as the main section. This is configurable, like so:
[params]
	mainSections = ["post"]
```

## Options

Ronu includes some customizable options, applied via the config file.


### Menu

Create a list of menu item links in the nav bar by assigning "menu.main" in the front matter, like so:

```toml
[[menu.main]]
	name = "Home"
	url = "/"
	weight = 1
	
[[menu.main]]
	name = "Blog"
	url = "/blog/"
	weight = 2
```

### Social
Inform your audience about your social presense in the footer, like so:

```toml
[author]
	name = "Your Name"
	twitterURL = "https://twitter.com/FooBar"
	githubURL = "https://github.com/FooBar"
	linkedinURL = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/FooBar"
	email = "foobar@foobar.com"
```

### Site Description
'description' is used in site heading and the meta info headers in the generated html, configurable as:
```toml
[params]
	description = "Your awesome site description"
```

### Theme colours

Ronu supports Automatic dark/light mode based on system preference.
Ronu theming is based on [Sakura color scheme](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/tree/master/css).

Files with reference values are available in the above link.
To apply a particular theme, copy the css of your choice into the css directory and include it in the partial `head.html`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and I will review and consider pull requests.  
Primary goals are:

- Keep it simple. (E.g. Do not add Disqus commenting as readability is the main aspect of this theme, not bells and whistles)
- Keep minimal (or zero) default configuration.
- Avoid interference of content templates with user-defined layouts (css).
- Avoid using JS
